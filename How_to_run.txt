1) In prepare_datasets directory, find prepare_physionet.py, change the path of variable:
	"--output_dir","--select_ch", tmp, filename
2) In prepare_datasets directory, in sleep_study, in data.py, change the path of variable:
	age_path
3) In prepare_datasets directory, in sleep_study, in info.py, change the path of variable:
	path
4) In prepare_datasets directory, in sleep_study, in data.py, change the number "0" in:
	channels=ss.info.EEG_CH_NAMES[0] to the channel of data you want to train and test.
5) Run prepare_physionet.py to prepare datasets of NCH data.
6) In utils/util.py, change the variable: files_pairs.
	In the given code, it combines the data of the first 4 files into 1 file (age 0-3),
 	combines the data of the last 4 files into 1 file (age 4-7).
7) In config.json, change "name", "num_folds".
	In the given code, num_folds = 2 because 2 files are used in 6).
8) In Katana, run the code:
	module load python/3.7
	(Then change the path to your files use cd command, activate your python environment)
	chmod +x batch_train.sh
	./batch_train.sh 0 Attnsleep_nch/prepare_datasets/sleep_study/wavelet_03_47
	(change the path in the above line)
9) Results are saved in "saved" directory
